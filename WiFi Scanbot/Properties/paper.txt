European Union Directive 95/46/EC
The European Union (EU), as a collective administrative and economic body, has always attempted to ensure that member states adhere to common standards where it applies to human rights, privacy, and the application of laws to individual citizens. As the Internet developed, many EU member nations began to adopt their own standards for privacy and personal data handling. The European Union Directive 95/46/EC published in 1995 was an attempt to provide direction for these nations on how to properly handle personal data. Specifically, the directive deals with “the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data”. 
Prior to this directive, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had published its “Recommendations of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data” in 1980. This documented seven principles for protecting personal data (Appendix A). The EU directive incorporated all of these principles without modification. 
As a member nation of the EU, businesses operating in the United Kingdom are certainly within the scope of this directive. However, as a directive (as opposed to a regulation), 95/46/EC is open to interpretation by each country in the European Union. All member states had to enact their own laws that would put them in compliance with the directive. The United Kingdom has implemented it's data protection laws in the Data Protection Act of 1998.

United Kingdom's Data Protection Act of 1998
While some European Union member states copied the EU Data Protection Directive verbatim, the United Kingdom determined it's own interpretation of the directive. This interpretation has been put into law in the form of the Data Protection Act of 1998. This act replaced an earlier UK law, the Data Protection Act of 1984. In the 1998 version, much of the focus is on the handling and processing of personal data. Personal data, in the scope of this law, is defined as data that can be used to personally identify a living person. This means that anonymised data or data that is grouped together without personal identifiers is out of scope for this law.
